I am a self-motivated software developer. I strive to improve my technical knowledge and soft skills through reading and research. Where I find something interesting, I share this with my colleagues during our learning sessions. I enjoy working with members of other development teams, as well as the product and management teams to ensure we deliver the right product to our customers. I am a believer in the agile development approach. I think small commits and frequent small releases are important to reduce issues and decrease the time to deliver. I like to take on larger projects where I see technological impediments or process issues in the wider department. Our relationships at work are critical to helping each other succeed and the success of our company. I seek regular feedback from my colleagues and regularly reflect on interactions within my current team and beyond.

## Employment

### Vonage _(2013 - Now)_

 `Senior Software Engineer`

Throughout my time at Vonage I have progressed and broadened my experience through working with different teams in my constantly evolving role.

- In my first two teams I was a Windows based .net Framework engineer working in mostly MVC projects. I was focused on TDD, improving my C#, and had an interest in process improvement. I gained knowledge of our telephony stack and then started working with WebRTC call delivery.

- In my next team I learned golang and was core to developing our contact centres API Platform. This project is still in use, handling ~260m requests each day. In this team I also worked hard to improve my front end skills, learning Javascript, React and Redux. I took ownership of a whole department meeting, to help share knowledge and solve common problems across teams.

- My previous team merged with another and my responsibilities widened. I was now part of a team that owned our most used UI, the supporting services and browser extensions for it, our UI for contact centre agents. As the team developed I pushed for improvements to the performance of this interface. I also extracted its core code from our monolith, enabling us to deploy it independently. I quickly took the opportunity to try and use the WebRTC offering from another company that Vonage had purchased, I convinced the business to allow our team to implement the work properly, saving us millions each year that we were spending with our competitor.

- Due to a shift in the department to stream-aligned teams, my team was again merged with another. The teams domain was assigned as the Agent Experience. My efforts to organize and update this area of the product led to us owning it. Whilst in this team I have taken opportunities to lead technically with WebRTC and work in the UI as well as more generally in the team, gaining a promotion recognizing these efforts. I have also looked to solve department wide problems with this solution, as many teams contribute to it, I felt the need to better share the technical direction the team wanted to take with the project. I authored the contributing guide for the project including a project specific Tech Radar.

### Hewlett Packard _(2011 - 2013)_

`Software Developer`

- In this role, I developed parts of a new multi-threaded component in C++ on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I gained knowledge in object orientated design patterns and experience in unit testing. While in this team I took responsibility for the CI pipeline for the team.

### Intel Corporation UK _(2007 - 2008)_

`Technical Marketing Engineer`

- I completed a year’s work for Intel as my placement year in between my studies. I ran benchmarks to support marketing efforts for both Desktop and server components.
