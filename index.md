## Employment


`2013 - Present`
__Vonage (Previously NewVoiceMedia)__

_Senior Software Engineer_

Throughout my time at Vonage I have progressed through many different teams with an ever-evolving role. 

- I started as a Windows based .net Framework engineer working in mostly MVC projects. I was focused on TDD, improving my C#, and had an interest in process improvement.

- In my next team I became the only C# engineer in a team focused on the telephony stack. Here I grew in ability and confidence. Here I started working with WebRTC call delivery. Eventually sought out a move to team to gain broader experience. 

- In my next team I learned go and was core to developing our contact centres API Platform, this project is still in use handling ~260m requests each day. In this team I also worked hard to improve my front end skills, learning Javascript, React and Redux. In this team I became responsible for development of our WebRTC browser extension and it supporting services. During this time I took ownership of a whole department meeting, to help share knowledge and solve common problems across teams. While in this team I became more interested in our WebRTC implementation, becoming the unofficial SME for it in our part of the business.

- This team merged with another and my responsibilities broadened. I was now part of a team that owned most of the services and browser extensions that support our most used UI, our UI for contact centre agents. As the team developed I pushed for improvements to the performance of this interface. I also extracted it's core code from our monolith and ran a regular community of interest for the teams that contributed to this. This happened around the time NVM were acquired by Vonage, I quickly took the opportunity to try and use the RTC offering from another company that Vonage had purchased, I convinced the business to allow our team to implement the work properly, potentially saving us $3-4m a year that we were spending with our competitor at the time.

- Due to a shift in the department to more stream aligned teams, my team was merged with another. The teams domain was assigned as the Agent Experience. I think my efforts to organize and update this area of the product had an impact on this decision. Whilst in this team I have taken opportunities to lead technically with WebRTC and work in the UI as well as more generally in the team, gaining a promotion recognizing these efforts.

`2011 - 2013`
__Hewlett Packard__

_Software Developer_

- In this role, I developed parts of a new multi-threaded component in C++ on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I gained knowledge in object orientated design patterns and experience in unit testing using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. While in this team I took responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of the team Jenkins server. I used this to automate Bullseye and Coverity builds for the department.

`2007 - 2008`
__Intel Corporation UK__

_Technical Marketing Engineer_

- I completed a year’s work for Intel as my placement year in between my studies. During this year I had two main roles. The first was supporting the performance benchmarking team within the UK. The second half of this year was spent with a different team setting up and running enterprise benchmarks.
