# Edward James Weston

I am a self motivated software developer. I like to read and try to constantly improve my technical knowledge and soft skills. Where I find something interesting, I share this knowledge with my colleagues during our learning sessions. I enjoy working with members of other dev teams, product teams and management teams to ensure we do the right thing at the time. I am a believer in the agile development approach, I think small commits and frequent small releases is important to reduce issues and decrease time to deliver. I like to take on larger projects where I see technological impediments or process issues in the wider department. Our relationships at work are critical to helping each other succeed and thus succeeding as a company. I like to remain open to feedback from my colleagues and hope that they feel comfortable giving me feedback too.

## Employment

### Vonage _(2013 - Now)_

 `Senior Software Engineer`

Throughout my time at Vonage I have progressed through many different teams with an constantly evolving role.

- I started as a Windows based .net Framework engineer working in mostly MVC projects. I was focused on TDD, improving my C#, and had an interest in process improvement.

- In my next team I became the only C# engineer in a team focused on the telephony stack. Here I grew in ability and confidence. Here I started working with WebRTC call delivery. Eventually sought out a move to team to gain broader experience.

- Once I had moved teams I learned 'go' and was core to developing our contact centres API Platform, this project is still in use handling ~260m requests each day. In this team I also worked hard to improve my front end skills, learning Javascript, React and Redux. During this time I took ownership of a whole department meeting, to help share knowledge and solve common problems across teams. I also became more interested in our WebRTC implementation, becoming the unofficial SME for it.

- This team merged with another and my responsibilities broadened. I was now part of a team that owned most of the services and browser extensions that support our most used UI, our UI for contact centre agents. As the team developed I pushed for improvements to the performance of this interface. I also extracted it's core code from our monolith enabling us to deploy it independently. Identifying an issue with communication between teams that worked on this project I set up a community of interest to allow us to share best practice and the future vision of the project. Around the time NVM were acquired by Vonage, I quickly took the opportunity to try and use the RTC offering from another company that Vonage had purchased, I convinced the business to allow our team to implement the work properly, saving us $3-4m a year that we were spending with our competitor at the time.

- Due to a shift in the department to more stream aligned teams, my team was merged with another. The teams domain was assigned as the Agent Experience. I think my efforts to organize and update this area of the product had an impact on this decision. Whilst in this team I have taken opportunities to lead technically with WebRTC and work in the UI as well as more generally in the team, gaining a promotion recognizing these efforts.

### Hewlett Packard _(2011 - 2013)_

`Software Developer`

- In this role, I developed parts of a new multi-threaded component in C++ on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I gained knowledge in object orientated design patterns and experience in unit testing using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. While in this team I took responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of the team Jenkins server.

### Intel Corporation UK _(2007 - 2008)_

`Technical Marketing Engineer`

- I completed a year’s work for Intel as my placement year in between my studies. During this year I had two main roles. The first was supporting the performance benchmarking team within the UK. The second half of this year was spent with a different team setting up and running enterprise benchmarks.
